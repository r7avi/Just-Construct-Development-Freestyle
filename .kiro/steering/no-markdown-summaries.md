# No Markdown Documentation Files

Do not create markdown files (.md) to summarize work, document processes, or track changes unless explicitly requested by the user. This includes:

- Summary files
- Documentation of changes made
- Process documentation
- Work logs or changelogs (unless part of the project structure)

Focus on code and configuration changes only. The user can review changes through version control and chat history.
