# Reference ID Requirement

All code changes, commits, and modifications must include a strict reference to @r7avi in comments and commit messages.

When making changes:
- Add comments with the reference: `// @r7avi - [description of change]`
- Include @r7avi in all commit messages
- Reference @r7avi in code documentation for new features or modifications

This ensures proper tracking and attribution of all changes.
